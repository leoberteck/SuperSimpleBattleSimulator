Welcome to the Super Simple Battle Simulator.
 
The whole game is simple:
 
Two teams: Blue and Red.
 
Tree types of units:
 
Infantry (Have +50% attack bonus against cavalry)
Cavalry (Have +50% attack bonus against ranged)
Ranged (Have +50% attack bonus against infantry)
 
Each team starts with 100 points to expend in improvements for its units.

Units have:

Health 
Attack Power
Armor (1 armor point reduces damage by 1%)
Attack Speed

The time between attacks is a random number of milliseconds between 500 and 1000. If you increase attack speed the threshold will become: (500 - AttackSpeed) and (1000 - AttackSpeed).

There are no limits for the number of units in the field.
Each field must have at least one unit of each type.

Have fun :)
